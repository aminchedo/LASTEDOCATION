### Backend Code Improvements
**File:** `BACKEND/src/routes/experiments.ts`

The following TypeScript best practice improvements were integrated:

   - To `res.status(X).json(...); return;` pattern
   - Added explicit `: void` return type annotations

2. **Routes Updated:**
   - POST `/` - Create experiment endpoint
   - POST `/:id/start` - Start experiment endpoint  
   - POST `/:id/stop` - Stop experiment endpoint
   - DELETE `/:id` - Delete experiment endpoint
   - GET `/:id/download` - Download experiment endpoint

### Documentation Added
**File:** `BRANCH_MERGE_READINESS_REPORT.md`
- Comprehensive analysis of branch readiness
- Verification results
- Pre-existing issue documentation

## Technical Validation

### Code Quality Checks
- âœ… TypeScript compilation passes
- âœ… Linting passes (tsc --noEmit)
- âœ… No merge conflicts
- âœ… No breaking changes
- âœ… Backwards compatible

### Testing Notes
- Pre-existing client TypeScript errors remain (documented in merge readiness report)
- These errors existed before the merge and are unrelated to backend changes
- Backend-specific changes are isolated and verified

---

## Cleanup Recommendations

### Optional: Delete Feature Branch
Since the merge is complete, you can optionally delete the feature branch:

**Local:**
```bash
git branch -d cursor/enhance-ci-cd-pipelines-and-fix-typescript-errors-f9fa
```

**Remote (after pushing main):**
```bash
git push origin --delete cursor/enhance-ci-cd-pipelines-and-fix-typescript-errors-f9fa
```
