## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Implemented Security Measures:
1. **File Upload Validation**
   - Size limits (100MB max)
   - File type restrictions (CSV, JSON, TXT, JSONL)
   - MIME type verification

2. **Path Sandboxing**
   - All file operations restricted to `/workspace/storage/ai-lab`
   - Directory traversal protection
   - Input sanitization

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Training: 2 jobs per minute
   - Uploads: 10 per minute
   - Exports: 5 per minute

4. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication on all routes
   - User-specific data isolation

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **TTS Audio Generation**: Currently uses placeholder sine wave. Production would need:
   - Integration with Coqui TTS or Mozilla TTS
   - Persian-specific voice models
   - Proper vocoder implementation

2. **GPU Memory Management**: No automatic memory cleanup for large models

3. **Dataset Size**: Limited to 100MB per upload
