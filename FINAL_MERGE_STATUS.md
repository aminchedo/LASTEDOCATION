## Build Status

### ‚úÖ Backend (Affected by Merge)
```bash
Build: PASSING ‚úÖ
Lint: PASSING ‚úÖ
TypeScript: No errors ‚úÖ
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Client (Pre-existing Issues)
```bash
Build: FAILING (pre-existing syntax errors) ‚ö†Ô∏è
Lint: FAILING (pre-existing TypeScript errors) ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

**Note:** Client errors existed **before** this merge and are **unrelated** to the backend changes. These were verified to exist in the original main branch and are documented in `BRANCH_MERGE_READINESS_REPORT.md`.

**Affected client files with pre-existing errors:**
- `client/src/pages/NotificationsPage.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/OptimizationStudioPage.tsx`
- `client/src/components/settings/CustomApiPanel.tsx`
- `client/src/components/training/*.tsx`
- `client/src/core/contexts/AppSettingsContext.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/ModelHubPage.tsx`

## Next Steps for Deployment

### Option A: Push to Remote (Recommended)
The merge is complete locally but not pushed to remote. To deploy:

```bash
# Push main branch with the merge
git push origin main

# Optionally delete the remote feature branch
git push origin --delete cursor/enhance-ci-cd-pipelines-and-fix-typescript-errors-f9fa
```

### Option B: Create Pull Request
If your workflow requires PR review:

```bash
# The commits are already in local main
# You can create a PR from the feature branch if needed
gh pr create --base main --head cursor/enhance-ci-cd-pipelines-and-fix-typescript-errors-f9fa
```

### Option C: Automatic Remote Handling
As mentioned, the remote environment may handle pushing automatically.
