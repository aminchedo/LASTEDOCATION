## ⚠️ WHAT NEEDS ATTENTION

### 1. TypeScript Errors (135 total) - Priority: HIGH

**Impact:** Reduces type safety and developer experience  
**Fix Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Blocker:** No (system still compiles and runs)

**Categories:**
- 45 errors: Type interface mismatches (Dataset, TrainingJob, Experiment types)
- 32 errors: Hook/Context API mismatches (useTraining hook)
- 28 errors: Component props issues (Input component, CustomApiSettings)
- 18 errors: Type enumerations (DataSourceKind, job status)
- 12 errors: Authorization/API types (HeadersInit)

**Recommended Fix:**
Update type definitions in `src/shared/types/` to match backend API contracts.

### 2. Deprecated Dependencies - Priority: MEDIUM

**Affected Packages:**
- `multer@1.4.5-lts.2` (has known vulnerabilities)
- `inflight@1.0.6` (memory leak)
- `glob@7.2.3` (no longer supported)

**Fix Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Risk:** Medium (potential security vulnerabilities)

### 3. Limited Test Coverage - Priority: MEDIUM

**Current State:**
- Unit tests: ~10% coverage
- Integration tests: Minimal
- E2E tests: ~5% coverage

**Fix Time:** 2-3 days  
**Impact:** Harder to catch regressions
