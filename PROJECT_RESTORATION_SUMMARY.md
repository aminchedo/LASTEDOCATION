1. **`scripts/train_cpu.py`** (Lines 16-101)
   - ✅ **FIXED**: Created real PyTorch alternative
   - Simulation code still exists but not used

2. **`BACKEND/src/routes/train.ts`** (Lines 24-195)
   - ✅ **FIXED**: Updated to use real training script

3. **`client/src/pages/DownloadCenterPage.tsx`** (Lines 401-548+)
   - 🟡 **IDENTIFIED**: 150+ lines of mock dataset array
   - **Action Required**: Remove and fetch from HuggingFace API

4. **`client/src/pages/ModelsDatasetsPage.tsx`** (Lines 118-144)
   - 🟡 **IDENTIFIED**: Mock dataset fallback
   - **Action Required**: Remove after implementing real dataset API

5. **`BACKEND/src/training/trainer.ts`** (Lines 312-417)
   - 🟡 **IDENTIFIED**: Synthetic data generation
   - **Note**: OK for CPU-only baseline, real data loader preferred

### Minor (Lower Priority)

- Console.log statements (355+ across 26 files)
- Mock system metrics (Math.random())
- Placeholder voice services
