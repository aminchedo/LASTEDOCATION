## ✅ WHAT WORKS RIGHT NOW

**You can immediately:**
- ✅ Upload and validate datasets
- ✅ Create training jobs
- ✅ Monitor training progress
- ✅ View real-time metrics
- ✅ Manage checkpoints
- ✅ Use the beautiful UI

**With PyTorch installed (optional):**
- ✅ Train real neural networks
- ✅ Save model checkpoints
- ✅ Load and fine-tune HuggingFace models

**Without PyTorch:**
- ✅ System runs in simulation mode
- ✅ Demonstrates all functionality
- ✅ Perfect for testing/development
