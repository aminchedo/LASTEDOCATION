- Automated setup scripts (setup.sh, start.sh, stop.sh)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires Verification & Completion**
- Real HuggingFace API integration functionality
- Actual TensorFlow.js training implementation
- WebSocket real-time event system
- Complete API endpoint implementations
- Security middleware and authentication
- File system operations for model downloads

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Methodology

### Step 1: **System Verification** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Run these commands to understand current state:
./verify.sh                    # Check overall system health
npm run verify:all            # Run all verification scripts
npm run lint                  # Check TypeScript compilation
npm test                      # Run existing tests
```

### Step 2: **Database Verification** (15 minutes)
```sql
-- Verify database structure:
\dt                           -- List all tables
\d+ users                     -- Check users table structure
\d+ models                    -- Check models table structure
\d+ training_jobs             -- Check training_jobs table structure
-- Repeat for all 7 tables
```

### Step 3: **Service Implementation Verification** (60 minutes)
Examine and complete these critical services:

#### HuggingFace Service (`BACKEND/src/services/huggingface.service.ts`)
```typescript
// Verify these methods work with REAL API calls:
- validateToken(token: string)
- searchModels(query: string, token?: string) 
- getModelInfo(repoId: string, token?: string)
- downloadModel(repoId: string, destDir: string, token?: string, onProgress?: Function)
- listModelFiles(repoId: string, token?: string)
```

#### Training Service (`BACKEND/src/services/training.service.ts`)
```typescript
// Verify REAL TensorFlow.js implementation:
- createTrainingJob(userId, modelId, config)
- startTraining(jobId)
- Real neural network creation with tf.sequential()
- Actual model.fit() training with progress callbacks
- Checkpoint saving to database and filesystem
```

#### WebSocket Service (`BACKEND/src/services/websocket-real.service.ts`)
```typescript
// Verify real-time events:
- 'download:progress', 'download:complete', 'download:error'
- 'training:progress', 'training:complete', 'training:error'
- Room-based user targeting: socket.join(`user:${userId}`)
```

### Step 4: **API Endpoint Verification** (45 minutes)
Verify ALL endpoints in these files:
- `BACKEND/src/routes/sources-new.ts` (HuggingFace endpoints)
- `BACKEND/src/routes/training-new.ts` (Training endpoints)  
- `BACKEND/src/routes/settings-new.ts` (Settings endpoints)

### Step 5: **Frontend Integration Verification** (30 minutes)
Check these frontend components:
- `client/src/services/inference.service.ts` (TensorFlow.js browser integration)
- API service integration with backend
- WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- Persian UI components and responsiveness

## üß™ Testing & Verification Protocol

### **Mandatory Tests (Must Pass)**
```bash
# 1. TypeScript Compilation (0 errors required)
cd BACKEND && npm run lint
cd client && npm run lint

# 2. Database Connectivity
npm run verify:db

# 3. API Functionality
npm run verify:api

# 4. Build Process
npm run verify:build

# 5. Integration Testing
./test-api.sh

# 6. System Health
./verify.sh
```

### **Functional Testing Requirements**
1. **HuggingFace Integration Test**
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:3001/api/sources/search?q=persian"
   # Should return REAL models from HuggingFace
   ```

2. **Database Persistence Test**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO users (email, username, password_hash) VALUES ('test@test.com', 'test', 'hashed');
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@test.com';
   # Should persist and retrieve real data
   ```

3. **Training Service Test**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/training \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"modelType":"tts","epochs":5,"batchSize":32}'
   # Should create real training job with TensorFlow.js
   ```

4. **WebSocket Test**
   ```javascript
   const socket = io('http://localhost:3001');
   socket.on('training:progress', (data) => console.log(data));
   // Should receive real progress updates
   ```
