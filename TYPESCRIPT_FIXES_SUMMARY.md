# TypeScript Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

### 1. SettingsDrawer.tsx

- Fixed validation function signatures to return objects with `isValid` and `error` properties
- Fixed testApiConnection to accept settings object instead of separate parameters
- Fixed copyToClipboard to return Promise<boolean>

### 4. Training Components (CheckpointsTable, Controls, MetricsChart, ProgressCard)
- Updated to use `jobs` array from useTraining hook instead of non-existent `status` property
- Fixed Controls to derive current job from jobs array
- Removed unsupported properties like `pauseTraining`, `createCheckpoint`, `isLoading`

### 5. useTraining Hook
- Exported TrainingJob interface
- Added TrainingConfig interface export

### 6. LoginPage.tsx

### 7. Shared Types (index.ts)

### 8. UI Components
- Fixed Card component exports to only include Card, CardHeader, CardContent (removed non-existent CardTitle, CardDescription, CardFooter)

### 10. AuthService
- Added missing `refreshAuth()` method (returns false for now as refresh is not implemented)

### 11. ChatPage.tsx
- Wrapped Input components with proper div/label structure
- Removed unsupported `label` and `helperText` props from Input components

### 12. SettingsPage.tsx  
- Commented out training-related code that references non-existent `settings.training` property

### 13. Custom API Utils (customApi.ts)
- Updated validateApiUrl to return object with isValid and error properties
- Updated copyToClipboard to return Promise<boolean>
- Updated testApiConnection to accept settings object and return success/error object

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues

The following errors still need attention:

### Input Component Label Props
Many Input usages in SettingsPage.tsx still have `label` and `helperText` props that need to be converted to proper div/label wrappers. These are on lines:
- 790-795 (Model name)
- 797-802 (Repository ID)
- 816-822 (URL)
- 824-828 (Description)
- 934-943 (Custom API section)
- 967-1014 (Training settings - commented out but still has issues)

### HomePage.tsx
- Status comparison errors with training job statuses
- Missing properties like `finishedAt` and `repoId`

### ModelHubPage.tsx
- Missing ModelEntry export from useDownloads hook
- Wrong number of arguments to hook methods
- Missing properties on Model and DownloadJob types

### ModelsHubPage and TrainingHubPage
- QuickAction variant type issues ('primary' not assignable to allowed variants)

### NotificationsPage and OptimizationStudioPage
- Icon type issues (Lucide components not assignable to icon string union)

### TrainingJobsPage and TrainingStudioPage
- Various property access errors on TrainingJob
- Status comparison errors
- Missing or incorrectly typed properties

### TrainingPage.tsx
- Similar to other training pages, needs to use jobs array pattern

### inference.service.ts
- Type issues with TensorFlow.js tensors
- Property access on never type

## üìù Notes

1. The Input component from `@/shared/components/ui/Input` does not support `label` or `helperText` props. All usages need to manually wrap inputs with labels.

2. The training-related settings in SettingsPage reference a `training` property that doesn't exist in AppSettings type. This has been commented out but should either be removed or the type should be updated.

3. Many pages expect properties on types that don't exist in the shared types. The shared types have been updated with the most common ones, but some pages may need their own local types or the shared types may need further extension.

4. The Icon type used in some components expects a string union, but pages are passing Lucide React components directly. This needs a consistent approach - either update the Icon type or change how icons are passed.

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

1. Complete the Input component wrapper conversions in SettingsPage
2. Fix the remaining page-level errors systematically
3. Decide on training settings approach (remove or add to type)
4. Standardize icon usage across components
5. Run full TypeScript check to catch any remaining errors
6. Test all modified components to ensure functionality
