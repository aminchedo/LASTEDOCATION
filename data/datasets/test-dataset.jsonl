{"question": "What is machine learning?", "answer": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed."}
{"question": "What is deep learning?", "answer": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input."}
{"question": "What is natural language processing?", "answer": "Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language."}
{"question": "What is supervised learning?", "answer": "Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where the model is trained on labeled data, learning to map inputs to known outputs."}
{"question": "What is unsupervised learning?", "answer": "Unsupervised learning is a machine learning approach where the model identifies patterns and structures in unlabeled data without predefined categories."}
