## Technical Details

### Architecture

**Component Reuse:** Original pages are preserved and imported into hub pages:
- ✅ Zero code duplication
- ✅ All functionality intact
- ✅ Easy to maintain
- ✅ Gradual migration path

**Settings Storage:** Dual persistence strategy:
- localStorage for instant access
- Backend API for sync and backup

**Token Security:**
- Masked by default in UI
- Never logged in plaintext
- Validated before use
- Optional per-model tokens
