## 🎯 Next Phase: LLM Inference

**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 weeks (with GPU), 3-4 weeks (CPU only)

**Key Tasks**:
1. Create Python inference server
2. Load HuggingFace transformer model
3. Implement real text generation
4. Remove mock responses
5. Test end-to-end

**Success Criteria**:
- Can load Persian language model
- Generates unique responses (not from dataset)
- Response latency measured accurately
- Error handling works properly
