## üîß What Was Fixed

## üìö Documentation

- **DOWNLOAD_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - Detailed implementation guide
- **test-download.sh** - Automated testing script
- **API_ENDPOINTS.md** - API documentation (from main)
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick start guide (from main)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Force Push May Be Needed**: Since we merged main into this branch, the history has diverged from origin. Use `--force-with-lease` if regular push fails.

2. **Dist Files Included**: The dist/ directory is rebuilt and committed to ensure deployment compatibility.

3. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing API endpoints remain functional. New endpoints are additive.

4. **Backward Compatible**: Falls back to huggingface-cli if direct URLs are not available.
