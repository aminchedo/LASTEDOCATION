4568232 Refactor: Remove unnecessary return statements in experiment routes
```

---

## Changes Made

The branch contains TypeScript best practice improvements to the backend experiment routes:

### File: `BACKEND/src/routes/experiments.ts`

**Changes:**
1. Fixed TypeScript return statement patterns in Express route handlers
2. Changed from `return res.status(X).json(...)` to `res.status(X).json(...); return;`
3. Removed unnecessary `return` keywords before response sends
4. Added explicit `: void` return type annotations to route handlers

**Example:**
```typescript
// Before
if (!experiment) {
  return res.status(404).json({
    success: false,
    error: 'Experiment not found',
  });
}

// After
if (!experiment) {
  res.status(404).json({
    success: false,
    error: 'Experiment not found',
  });
  return;
}
```

## Pre-existing Issues (Not Related to This Branch)

The client (frontend) code has TypeScript errors, but these **existed in main** before this branch was created. This branch only modifies backend files and does not introduce or affect these errors.

**Files with pre-existing errors in both main and this branch:**
- `client/src/components/settings/CustomApiPanel.tsx`
- `client/src/components/training/CheckpointsTable.tsx`
- `client/src/components/training/Controls.tsx`
- `client/src/components/training/MetricsChart.tsx`
- `client/src/components/training/ProgressCard.tsx`
- `client/src/core/contexts/AppSettingsContext.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/ModelHubPage.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/NotificationsPage.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/OptimizationStudioPage.tsx`

**Note:** These client errors should be addressed in a separate effort, as they are unrelated to the backend improvements in this branch.

## Merge Recommendation

**✅ APPROVED FOR MERGE**

This branch is ready to be merged into main via pull request. The changes are:
- Isolated to backend code
