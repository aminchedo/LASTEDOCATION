## üö® Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

1. **Stop new deployment**
   ```bash
   pm2 stop ml-training-backend
   ```

2. **Rollback to previous version**
   ```bash
   git checkout <previous-commit>
   npm install
   npm run build
   pm2 restart ml-training-backend
   ```

3. **Verify rollback**
   - Check health endpoint
   - Test critical paths
   - Check error logs

4. **Restore database if needed**
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   pg_restore -d production_db backup_file.dump
   ```

5. **Notify team**
