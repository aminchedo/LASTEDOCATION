## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Frontend
cd client
npm install

# Backend
cd ../BACKEND
npm install
```

### Step 2: Build Check (Optional - for production)

```bash
# Build frontend
cd client
npm run build

# Build backend (if TypeScript)
cd ../BACKEND
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Start Services

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd BACKEND
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd client
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Smoke Test

Visit these URLs and verify they load without errors:

```
✓ http://localhost:5173/              (Dashboard)
✓ http://localhost:5173/models        (Models Hub - 3 tabs)
✓ http://localhost:5173/playground    (Playground Hub - 2 tabs)
✓ http://localhost:5173/training      (Training Hub - 2 tabs)
✓ http://localhost:5173/settings      (Settings with HF section)
```

### Step 5: Quick Functionality Test

1. **Navigation Test (30 seconds)**
   - Click each navigation item
   - Verify pages load
   - Check no console errors

2. **Tabs Test (1 minute)**
   - Click each tab in Models Hub
   - Click each tab in Playground Hub
   - Click each tab in Training Hub
   - Verify content displays

3. **Settings Test (2 minutes)**
   - Open Settings
   - Scroll to HuggingFace section
   - Enter a test token
   - Click validate (optional)
   - Click save
   - Refresh page
   - Verify settings persisted

## 📊 Quality Checks

### Browser Console
```
✅ No red errors
✅ No 404 requests
✅ API calls succeed or fail gracefully
⚠️  Development warnings are acceptable
```

### Network Tab
```
✅ /api/settings endpoint works
✅ /api/sources/download accepts token
✅ All API responses are valid JSON
```

### Visual Check
```
✅ Tabs are styled correctly
✅ Icons display properly
✅ Text is readable (RTL for Persian)
✅ Buttons respond to hover
✅ No layout shifts
```

## 🔒 Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Verify tokens never logged in plaintext
- [ ] Check tokens masked by default in UI
- [ ] Ensure HTTPS used in production
- [ ] Confirm no tokens in error messages
- [ ] Validate localStorage encryption (production)
- [ ] Test with invalid/malicious tokens
- [ ] Verify CORS settings

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

All must be ✅ before deploying:

### Navigation
- [ ] 5 main menu items visible
- [ ] Old routes redirect properly
- [ ] Mobile menu works

### Functionality
- [ ] All 7 tabs working
- [ ] Settings save/load correctly
- [ ] Token validation works
- [ ] Downloads include token

### Performance
- [ ] Page loads < 3 seconds
- [ ] Tab switching < 500ms
- [ ] No memory leaks

### Compatibility
- [ ] Works in Chrome
- [ ] Works in Firefox
- [ ] Works in Safari
- [ ] Mobile responsive

### No Regressions
- [ ] All existing features work
- [ ] No broken functionality
- [ ] No data loss
- [ ] No console errors

## 🐛 Rollback Plan

If critical issues are found:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push

# Or restore from backup
git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash>
git push --force
```

### Partial Rollback
If only one feature is broken:
- Comment out problematic routes in App.tsx
- Disable specific tabs temporarily
- Fall back to old navigation

### Data Safety
- ✅ No database migrations required
- ✅ localStorage data compatible
- ✅ API backward compatible
- ✅ Safe to rollback anytime

## 📞 Support Plan

### If Users Report Issues

1. **Gather Information**
   - Browser and version
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Console errors
   - Network errors

2. **Common Issues & Fixes**

   **Issue: Tabs don't appear**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Check browser console

   **Issue: Settings don't save**
