# CI Status Check Fix

## Problem Summary

The original CI status check script had two critical issues:

### 1. **Bash Syntax Error**

**Original (Broken):**
```bash
if [ "success" != "success" ] || \
  if [ "success" != "success" ] || \
     [ "success" != "success" ] || \
     [ "skipped" != "success" ]; then
    echo "❌ CI Failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Issue:** You cannot nest `if` statements within an `if` condition using the `||` operator. This is invalid bash syntax.

**Fixed:**
```bash
if [ "$STATUS1" != "success" ] && [ "$STATUS1" != "skipped" ]; then
    echo "❌ CI Failed - Job 1"
    exit 1
fi

if [ "$STATUS2" != "success" ] && [ "$STATUS2" != "skipped" ]; then
    echo "❌ CI Failed - Job 2"
    exit 1
fi
```

Or using compound conditions:
```bash
if [ "$STATUS1" != "success" ] && [ "$STATUS1" != "skipped" ] || \
   [ "$STATUS2" != "success" ] && [ "$STATUS2" != "skipped" ] || \
   [ "$STATUS3" != "success" ] && [ "$STATUS3" != "skipped" ]; then
    echo "❌ CI Failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

### 2. **Logic Error: "skipped" Status**

**Original Logic:**
```bash
[ "skipped" != "success" ]  # This evaluates to TRUE, causing failure
```

**Issue:** GitHub Actions jobs can have a "skipped" status when they are intentionally not run (e.g., due to path filters, conditions, or manual workflow dispatch options). This is a **valid, non-error state** and should not cause CI to fail.

**Fixed Logic:**
```bash
# Accept both "success" and "skipped" as passing statuses
if [ "$STATUS" = "success" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "skipped" ]; then
    echo "✅ CI Passed"
else
    echo "❌ CI Failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

## GitHub Actions Job Statuses

GitHub Actions jobs can have the following conclusions:

| Status | Description | Should Fail CI? |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `success` | Job completed successfully | ❌ No |
| `failure` | Job failed | ✅ Yes |
| `cancelled` | Job was cancelled | ✅ Yes (usually) |
| `skipped` | Job was skipped (conditional, path filter, etc.) | ❌ No |
| `null` | Job is still running or queued | ⏸️ Wait |

## Solutions Provided

### 1. **Workflow: `.github/workflows/ci-status-check.yml`**
   - Automatically checks workflow run status
   - Triggers on completion of other workflows
   - Generates status reports
   - Treats both "success" and "skipped" as passing

### 2. **Script: `scripts/check-ci-status.sh`**
   - Reusable bash script for checking multiple job statuses
   - Color-coded output
   - Detailed summary report
   - Can be used in any workflow or locally

### 3. **Workflow: `.github/workflows/ci-final-check.yml`**
   - Demonstrates the corrected syntax
   - Uses GitHub API to fetch actual job statuses
   - Shows both inline checking and script usage
   - Includes comprehensive reporting

## Usage Examples

### Using the Workflow
The workflow triggers automatically when other CI workflows complete:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["CI Pipeline - TypeScript Enforcement"]
    types:
      - completed
```

### Using the Script

**In a GitHub Actions workflow:**
```yaml
- name: Check CI statuses
  run: bash scripts/check-ci-status.sh success success skipped failure
```

**Locally:**
```bash
./scripts/check-ci-status.sh success success skipped
```

**With dynamic values:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
JOB1=$(gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs/:run_id/jobs | jq -r '.jobs[0].conclusion')
JOB2=$(gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs/:run_id/jobs | jq -r '.jobs[1].conclusion')

./scripts/check-ci-status.sh "$JOB1" "$JOB2"
```

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

```bash
# Test with all success (should pass)
./scripts/check-ci-status.sh success success success
echo "Exit code: $?"  # Should be 0

# Test with skipped (should pass)
./scripts/check-ci-status.sh success skipped success
echo "Exit code: $?"  # Should be 0

# Test with failure (should fail)
./scripts/check-ci-status.sh success failure success
echo "Exit code: $?"  # Should be 1
```

## Migration Guide

If you have existing workflows using the broken pattern:

**Before:**
```bash
if [ "$STATUS1" != "success" ] || \
  if [ "$STATUS2" != "success" ]; then
    echo "❌ CI Failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

**After (Option 1 - Individual checks):**
```bash
for status in "$STATUS1" "$STATUS2" "$STATUS3"; do
    if [ "$status" != "success" ] && [ "$status" != "skipped" ]; then
        echo "❌ CI Failed"
        exit 1
    fi
done
```

**After (Option 2 - Use the script):**
```bash
bash scripts/check-ci-status.sh "$STATUS1" "$STATUS2" "$STATUS3"
```

**After (Option 3 - Compound condition):**
```bash
if { [ "$STATUS1" != "success" ] && [ "$STATUS1" != "skipped" ]; } || \
   { [ "$STATUS2" != "success" ] && [ "$STATUS2" != "skipped" ]; } || \
   { [ "$STATUS3" != "success" ] && [ "$STATUS3" != "skipped" ]; }; then
    echo "❌ CI Failed"
    exit 1
fi
```
