- **Unified Focus Rings** (2px primary color) across all elements
- **Touch Targets** (â‰¥44Ã—44px) for perfect mobile UX

### âœ… Every Component Enhanced
1. **Buttons** - Tactile feedback (`scale-[.98]`), proper elevation, unified sizing
2. **Inputs** - Subtle shadows, hover states, error validation with icons
3. **Cards** - Three variants, hover lift effects, entrance animations
4. **Header** - Glass-morphic blur, translucent background, proper elevation
5. **Chat Bubbles** - Consistent shadows, improved spacing, styled code blocks
6. **Composer** - Premium input area, keyboard hints, smart FAB
7. **Monitoring** - Interactive cards, styled tables, color-coded badges
8. **Settings** - Enhanced forms, animated color pickers, responsive layout
9. **Modals** - Prominent shadows, smooth entrance, backdrop blur

### âœ… Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Keyboard navigation with visible focus
- Screen reader support with ARIA labels
- Color contrast â‰¥4.5:1 in both themes
- Proper semantic HTML and landmarks
- Reduced motion support

### âœ… RTL/LTR Support
