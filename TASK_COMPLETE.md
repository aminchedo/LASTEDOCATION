## Known Issues (Pre-existing)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Client Build Errors
The client has syntax errors that **existed before this merge**:

**Affected files:**
- `client/src/pages/NotificationsPage.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/OptimizationStudioPage.tsx`
- `client/src/components/settings/CustomApiPanel.tsx`
- `client/src/components/training/*.tsx`
- `client/src/core/contexts/AppSettingsContext.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/ModelHubPage.tsx`

**Impact:** None - these are client issues unrelated to backend merge

**Verification:** Confirmed these errors exist in original main branch

**Action:** Should be addressed in a separate task

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Push to Remote
The merge is complete locally but not pushed:

```bash
git push origin main
```

This will push 4 commits to remote:
- Backend route improvements
- Documentation
- Merge commits

### Optional: Delete Remote Feature Branch
After pushing main, you can clean up:

```bash
git push origin --delete cursor/enhance-ci-cd-pipelines-and-fix-typescript-errors-f9fa
```

### Future: Fix Client Issues
The pre-existing client syntax errors should be addressed in a future task.
