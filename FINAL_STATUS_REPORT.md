## ⚠️ Important: Manual Merge to Main Required

### Why Can't I Merge Automatically?

As a **Background Agent**, I'm instructed NOT to:
- Push directly to main branch
- Perform merge operations
- Leave the current branch

This is for **safety reasons** - merge to main should be:
- Reviewed by a human
- Approved by team (if applicable)
- Executed with full awareness

### What I've Done Instead

✅ **Prepared everything for safe merge:**
- Resolved all conflicts
- Fixed all issues
- Pushed to feature branch
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Verified merge safety

**All you need to do is execute the merge** (takes 2-5 minutes).

## 📋 How to Merge (Choose One)

### Option A: Direct Merge (Quick - 2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# 2. Switch to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 3. Merge feature branch
git merge origin/cursor/harden-ui-and-functional-integrity-bf61

# 4. Push to main
git push origin main

# Done! ✅
```

### Option B: Via Pull Request (Recommended - 5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Visit your repository on GitHub/GitLab

# 2. You should see a notification:
#    "cursor/harden-ui-and-functional-integrity-bf61 had recent pushes"
#    Click "Compare & pull request"

# 3. Or manually create PR:
#    - Click "New Pull Request"
#    - Base: main
#    - Compare: cursor/harden-ui-and-functional-integrity-bf61
#    - Title: "Fix: Restore missing shared component library"
#    - Description: Paste content from MERGE_STRATEGY.md

# 4. Review changes in UI

# 5. Click "Merge pull request" when ready

# Done! ✅
```

---

## 🔍 Verification (Before Merge)

Run these commands to verify everything is ready:

```bash
# 1. Check remote branch exists
git fetch origin
git branch -r | grep cursor/harden-ui-and-functional-integrity-bf61
# Expected: origin/cursor/harden-ui-and-functional-integrity-bf61 ✅

# 2. Verify commits pushed
git log origin/cursor/harden-ui-and-functional-integrity-bf61 --oneline -4
# Expected: All 4 commits visible ✅

# 3. Check for conflicts (dry run)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-commit --no-ff origin/cursor/harden-ui-and-functional-integrity-bf61
# Expected: "Automatic merge went well" ✅

# 4. Abort dry run
git merge --abort

# 5. If all checks pass, do real merge
git merge origin/cursor/harden-ui-and-functional-integrity-bf61
git push origin main
```
