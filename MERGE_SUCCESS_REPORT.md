## 🔧 Conflict Resolution

### Conflicts Encountered: 8 files

All conflicts were **"add/add" conflicts** where both branches created the same files with different implementations:

1. ✅ `client/src/shared/components/ui/Badge.tsx` - RESOLVED
2. ✅ `client/src/shared/components/ui/Button.tsx` - RESOLVED
3. ✅ `client/src/shared/components/ui/Card.tsx` - RESOLVED
4. ✅ `client/src/shared/components/ui/EmptyState.tsx` - RESOLVED
5. ✅ `client/src/shared/components/ui/Input.tsx` - RESOLVED
6. ✅ `client/src/shared/components/ui/Skeleton.tsx` - RESOLVED
7. ✅ `client/src/shared/services/api.service.ts` - RESOLVED
8. ✅ `client/src/shared/utils/api.ts` - RESOLVED

### Resolution Strategy

**Chose feature branch versions** for all conflicts because they have:
- ✅ Enhanced TypeScript types
- ✅ Full accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Complete RTL support
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Consistent API design
- ✅ More features (loading states, variants, etc.)

## 🔍 How to Use Components

import { Button } from '@/shared/components/ui/Button';
import { Card } from '@/shared/components/ui/Card';
import { Input } from '@/shared/components/ui/Input';
```

### Example Usage
```tsx
import { Button } from '@/shared/components/ui/Button';
import { Card, CardHeader, CardContent } from '@/shared/components/ui/Card';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card variant="elevated">
      <CardHeader title="عنوان" />
      <CardContent>
        <Button 
          variant="primary" 
          loading={isLoading}
          onClick={handleClick}
        >
          ذخیره
        </Button>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** "Cannot find module '@/shared'"
```bash
# Solution: Install dependencies
cd client
npm install
# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

**Issue:** TypeScript errors
```bash
# Solution: Check tsconfig.json paths
# Ensure it has:
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["./src/*"]
}
```

**Issue:** Components not rendering
```bash
# Solution: Clear Vite cache
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

**Issue:** Import errors after merge
```bash
# Solution: Update imports to @/shared
# Old: import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
# New: import { Button } from '@/shared/components/ui/Button';
```
